# Item-Catalog
Developed an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.

Built a RESTful web application using the Python framework Flask along with implementing third-party OAuth authentication. I learned to use the various HTTP methods available to me and how these methods relate to CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations.
